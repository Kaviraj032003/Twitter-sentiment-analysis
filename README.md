# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiment in Twitter data using machine learning techniques. By leveraging natural language processing and sentiment analysis algorithms, we gain valuable insights into the public's perception and emotions on a given topic or brand.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tweepy

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Obtain Twitter API credentials and update `config.py` with your keys.

## Data Collection
- Utilize Tweepy to fetch real-time tweets based on keywords or user handles.
- Store the collected data in a CSV file for further analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the raw text data by removing noise, special characters, and stopwords.
- Perform tokenization and apply techniques such as stemming or lemmatization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Gain insights into the dataset through visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Understand distribution, frequency, and patterns of sentiments.

## Model Training
- Implement machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) for sentiment classification.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.

## Deployment
- Deploy the trained model for real-time sentiment analysis on new Twitter data.

## Results
- Interpret and communicate sentiment trends through visualizations and summary statistics.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with deep learning models for enhanced sentiment analysis.
- Implement real-time monitoring and update the model periodically.
